# Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'd been teaching myself web development for about a year now. 
I am now studying software developoment with [Founders and Coders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) ğŸ’»

### What do I do? 

Glad you asked... ğŸ˜„

- I operate a forklift. :construction:
- Before that, I was a yoga instructor (I still am :wink:). :muscle:
- And before that, I was a paid musician. :guitar:
- And before that, I was a sailor. :sailboat:

### Fun Fact
I speak Spanish. I know. That's not funny, but it's useful.

I also know some Mandarin, Nepalese, Greek and Hebrew, but please don't test me, trust me :wink:

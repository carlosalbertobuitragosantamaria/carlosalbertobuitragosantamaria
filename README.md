# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I've been teaching myself web development for about a year now. I'm hoping to start a course this summer and change career byt autumn.

### What do I do? Glad you asked... ðŸ˜„

- I operate a forklift. :construction:
- Before that, I was a yoga instructor (I still am :wink:). :muscle:
- And before that, I was a paid musician. :guitar:
- And before that, I was a sailor. :sailboat:

### Fun Fact
I speak Spanish. I know that's not funny, but it's useful.

I also know some Mandarin, Nepalese, Greek and Hebrew, but please don't test me, just trust me :wink:
